AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

This application is used to genearte a team profile based on the input provided by the user.
User will be prompted to enter with the team Manager's details - Name, Id, Email and Phone #. For Phone #, there is a validation to check for a valid phone number.
Then the next step is to make a selection for the team members for an engineer/intern/end application.
Based on the user provided answers, engineer details and Intern details will be used to create the html.
